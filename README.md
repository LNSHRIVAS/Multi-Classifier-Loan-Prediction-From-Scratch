# Multi-Classifier-Loan-Prediction-From-Scratch
This project implements four classification algorithmsâ€”Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression all from scratch in an end-to-end loan prediction pipeline. It also includes a PCA implementation to reduce dimensionality , demonstrating a complete workflow from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
